# Shinjitsu Box (open source)

## About

Source code for the Shinjitsu Box (hardware required; Pi Pico WH, Pimoroni Pico Display Pack 2.0).
[https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico?variant=32402092294227]


## Install

Install Thonny, Install MicroPython to Pico, copy all files to Pico via Thonny.


## Rant

Added temperature from internal Pico as a variable in random functions.
... short version, results are influenced by enivironment unlike all other "spirit/ghost boxes" that are run from pseudo RND seeds.
Some math formulas need proper testing, code is a quick hack from various sources (I learned MicroPython in a week just to code this much) therefore this code is being released as Proof of Concept.
All graphics are mine, except for the bootup Nyan Cat and 2 YouTube channel avatars for;

Both of whom have been an invaluable source of information and entertainment, and inspired this idea.
